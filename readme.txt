This is a demo of ThemeDictionary that will read in the words of an unformated text (literray works, etc) and then generate random combinations of words

currently it is reading the entire text of Moby Dick

If you want to test it with something else simply ovverite the moby.txt file with something else,  or edit the DictionaryDemo.cpp to call with differnt paramaters.
(a menu screen to come soon for input of source file name)


type "make" and enjoy!
